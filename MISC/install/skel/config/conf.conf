### dd any config sections and/or options which should be considered "default". That is, the ones which should be
### automatically added to any fresh config/conf.conf files that get generated with the skel directory during system
### installs, context resets / overwrites, etc.
### Put simply, as long as it is valid, everything in this file, including single hash comments, will be written to the
### install files, except for lines that start with a triple hash( as in '###'), which will be ignored.
